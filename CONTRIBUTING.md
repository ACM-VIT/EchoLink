# Ground Rules

Our primary aim is to **foster a diverse and welcoming community** for all **contributors and participants** in the **EchoLink app**. Your commitment to this **Code of Conduct** is vital in ensuring a **positive and inclusive environment**.

## Be Considerate

Your contributions have a ripple effect. Consider the impact of your decisions on **users and fellow contributors**. Changes during a release, be it in **code, infrastructure, policy, documentation, or translations**, can influence others' work. Always be mindful of the **broader impact**.

## Be Respectful

**Respect** is at the core of the **ACM-VIT community**. While disagreements may arise, maintaining decorum is non-negotiable. We encourage a **positive atmosphere** where every individual, **regardless of their background**, can make **valuable contributions**. Disagreements should be resolved constructively without resorting to personal attacks.

## Be Collaborative

**Collaboration** is central to the ethos of **ACM-VIT** and the wider **open-source community**. Embrace **transparency** in your work, contribute **patches back to the community**, and keep **upstream projects informed** if you're working on new code for them. While consensus may take time, keeping the community informed nurtures a culture of **collaboration**.

## When You Disagree, Consult Others

Disagreements, whether political or technical, are common. Resolve them constructively with community input. If opting for a different direction, consider creating a **derivative distribution or alternate set of packages**. This ensures the preservation of a **common core**, facilitating ongoing **collaboration**.

## When Unsure, Ask for Help

No one possesses all the answers, and **questions are encouraged**. Respond to questions with helpful insights. When seeking assistance, use an **appropriate forum(Please contact the project maintainers via email/message)** to foster effective communication.

## Step Down Considerately

People transition in and out of projects, and in the **ACM-VIT community**, we recognize and honour that. If you decide to leave or reduce your involvement, communicate your departure and take steps to **minimize disruption**. Enable others to seamlessly continue the work you leave behind.
